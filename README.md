# steel-template-gatsby ðŸ§©

Steel is a sudo framework for building e-commerce websites. Learn more about the Steel ecosystem [here](https://github.com/stordahl/steel)


## ðŸš€ Quick start

0. Make sure you have your Steel Studio setup before moving forward. More info on that [here](https://github.com/stordahl/steel-studio)

1. Click the 'Use Template' button to generate your own repo

2. Clone your new repo to your local machine

3. npm install the gatsby-cli and all dependencies

  ```shell
    cd your-project-dir && npm i -g gatsby-cli && npm i
  ```

4. Place your Sanity *project ID & dataset name*, as well as your *Snipcart API key* into gatsby-config.js

5. Edit the details of *gatsby-plugin-manifest* in gatsby-config.js

*note: you can use this template without connecting to the Steel Studio specifically. Just make sure your Snipcart related page queries match your Sanity schema, and verify the JSX template in /src/components/Product.js matches that query as well

## ðŸ‘‹ Contributing
